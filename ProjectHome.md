The research in computational advertising is greatly limited by the accessibility of dataset. Most of datasets, including keywords, webpages, targetting, bids, creatives, click-through rates, revenue, and etc, are possessed by companies like Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, and are not open to the public. Apparently this limitation is reasonable to protect the business, but harmful for this research area. Researchers interested in relevant problems cannot start working until establishing a good connection with 3rd party companies; experiment results published in papers are hard to validate or compare.

Therefore researchers in University College London began to create an independent computational advertising dataset from publicly available sources, including search engines, tools provided by ad network/exchange platforms, and validated reports. We hope this effort is helpful and valuable to the research community; and with more and more standardized open datasets we hope more and more researchers could get involved, and the online advertising business becomes more relevant, cost-effective, and profitable.
